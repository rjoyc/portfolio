# portfolio
my first portfolio website! it is also my first react project! this is the first iteration of the portfolio website i designed for myself. in this first iteration, i have only implemented a simple landing page. in my next iteration, it is my goal to transfer my case studies and other pages all onto the website. it's been exciting to work on a website all from scratch and i'm excited to see how it changes over time! check out the repo to see how it's been progressing! 

see the live website [here](https://rjoyc.github.io/portfolio/) ðŸŽ‰!

## next steps
- focus on responsive design. create screens for all types of screens.
- design and build pages for case studies and other links

## local development
